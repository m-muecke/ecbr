The goal of ecbr is to provide a simple interface to the [ECB API](https://data.ecb.europa.eu/help/api/overview).
The main difference to other packages is that it's a modern implementation using the [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org) package.

## Installation
You can install the development version of ecbr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("m-muecke/ecbr")
```
